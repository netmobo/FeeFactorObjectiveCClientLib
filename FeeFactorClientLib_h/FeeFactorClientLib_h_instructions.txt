Developer Netmobo Linking Documentation

Steps to use Netmobo in your iOS application:
With both your app project and the Netmobo source project open, do the following:

1. Drag the file 'libNetmobo.a' from its Frameworks grouping to your project's Frameworks grouping and make sure 'copy' is selected from the alert window.
2. Next, drag the grouping 'Netmobo' to your project--this grouping contains Netmobo's header files.
3. Then, from your project's menu 'Project' -> 'Edit Project Settings' and click on 'Build' tab
4. search for 'Header Search Paths' which is under 'Search Paths'
5. click '+' and double-click on 'path' and type in '/usr/include/libxml2'
6. search for 'other linker Flags' which is under 'linking'
7. click '+' and add '-lxml2' 
optionally, if you are having problems compiling, you may also add the ff to 'other link': 
-ObjC
-all_load
